    "text": "Prerequisites\nBefore starting this course you will need to ensure that your computer is set up with the required software. If you have any difficulty installing any of this software then please contact the trainer at sandun.rajapaksa@petermac.org for help.\n\nStep 1: Installing Python\nThere are multiple ways you can use Python. The easiest and most convenient way is to install Python on your own computer. However, if you prefer to avoid the installation process or need additional computational capabilities the alternative option is to use the cluster.\n\nInstall Python on your own computer\nFor new users, we recommend installing Anaconda. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages.\n\n\nWindows\n\nIf you have admin rights, follow Anaconda Navigator Installation. Otherwise, contact the IT Support.\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nInstall the Anaconda Navigator from the Anaconda Navigator Installation.\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nInstall the Anaconda Navigator from here.\n\nOnce installed, open the anaconda-navigator directly or type the following command in the terminal to open it.\n\nanaconda-navigator\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anaconda Navigator\n\n\nUseful links:\n\nGetting started with Navigator\nHow to create/manage environments?\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Installing Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\nOnce Python is installed, the next step is to install a preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to start coding with Python. If you are a new user, we suggest using the Jupyter Notebook.\n\nInstall Jupyter Notebook on your own computer\n\nOpen Anaconda Navigator and click install Jupyter Notebook.\nLaunch the Jupyter Notebook directly from the Anaconda Navigator or start the notebook server from the command line by typing the following command.\n\n\njupyter notebook \n\n\nYou should see the notebook home page open in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Jupyter Notebook\n\n\n\nTo install Jupyter Notebook, see Installing Jupyter Notebook.\n\nUseful links:\n\nJupyter Notebook Documentation\nHow to use Jupyter Notebooks - DataCamp\nJupyter Notebook: An Introduction\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Installing a Python library\nIf you are currently using Python using conda (or Anaconda) or if you are using the cluster, a Python library can be installed with Anaconda or Miniconda. For example, to install the pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries of Python use the following command on the terminal.\n\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas matplotlib numpy\n\nIf you installed Python using Pip, then a Python library can be installed via pip from Python Package Index (PyPI). To install the required libraries of Python use the following command on the terminal.\n\npip install pandas matplotlib numpy\n\nIf Anaconda Navigator is installed and you prefer to use the Navigator instead of typing commands on a terminal refer to Installing and managing Python packages.",
